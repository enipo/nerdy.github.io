    <span>I</span> came across <i>p5.js</i> a while ago. It's a javascript
    port of a really cool project called '<span>Processing</span>'. I've started
    using these two projects for both a tryout of my bands lightshow
    and for my future websites, interactive and real-time
    presentations.<br />
    I don't really know how I missed it because it's been around for
    a while but what really made me interested was this Youtube channel
    '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">
    <span>The coding train</span></a>'.<br /><br />
    I've been working on a proof of concept app for (first of all) musicians
    to share, catalog and keep track of changes in music files. Allowing bands to work
    together and be able to easily share changes made.<br />
    I've been using Vue.js in combination with Electron in a package called vuetify.
    It's been a <span>nice change</span>!

  and being on stage is slightly all the way in favor of rehearsal. But I guess this is the
  case for most if not all musicians.<br />

  Someone in the soundcloud resides music that I have made in the fall of 2017 when I was
  travelling through Portugal.
